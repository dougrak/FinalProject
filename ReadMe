Hello! Welcome to my webscraping, data wrangling, and regression modeling project!

The programs are meant to be run in the following order:
1. ScrapeOlympediaAthletics.py
---> creates: Olympics_Athletics_Results.csv

2. CleanUp.py
---> creates: Olympics_Athletics_Results_cleaned.csv

3. Regression.py 

The scraping programe takes some time to run, so I suggest skipping it and using
the output file, Olympics_Athletics_Results.csv, as provided. You can also skip
CleanUp.py as I included its output.

I would appreciate any feedback!

Best wishes,
Doug Rakel
